# StatMasterApp
Repository contains relevant files from the development of a baseball statistics tracking android application.

The files included are the backend java files related and the frontend XML files.

Also included is a folder of screenshots from the functioning application which was live on the Google Play Store for approximately a year.

The complete source code for the application is unavailible so the included files will not run as a function application in Android studio.
